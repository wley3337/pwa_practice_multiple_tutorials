# Please note that this is not my original work and is a record of my exploration of PWA's 


## This is collection of tutorials found online. I will leave links where I can to the original tutorials. 

1. /pwa-tutorial-1 follows [this tutorial](https://engineering.musefind.com/build-your-first-progressive-web-app-with-react-8e1449c575cd) somewhat unsuccesffuly. 
* Issues atm: serviceworker registers from index.html, but does not seem to register under Lamplight or console.log the sequence of clearing the cache even after a full copy/paste instead of codeing along. -need to investigate serviceworkers more.
